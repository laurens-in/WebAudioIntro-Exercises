### Exercise 1

First open your terminal and run `npm install`.

In the folder `/problems` you will find enumerated files containing specific problems that you need to solve.

The problems are described in comments inside the files. Make sure to put the `export` statement in the way that the problem requires. See `problem1.js` for an example.

If you solved a problem you can run `npm run test problem<X>` to test the specific problem and see if you solved it. You can also run tests for all the problems with `npm run test`.
